I just need some
Space
I just need some space
Space
I just need some space
Space
I just need some space
Space
I just need some space
Way up, way up,
How I feel right now
Touch down,
Whole city get loud
But I don't wanna hear
nothin' right now
Right now, they talk,
but I don't hear a sound
Just in, I'm on Billboard now
Pop boy that know
how to get down
Get down, no,
they can't get me down
I talked to God just now,
he told me,
"Boy, go make me proud"
So I can't slow down, no,
I can't go down
Got my head in the clouds,
feelin' like
I just need some
Space
I just need some space
Space
I just need some space
Space
I just need some space
Space
I just need somе
Space,
like I'm chillin' in a Wraith
I'ma rock it like
I'm NASA whеn I'm walkin'
on the stage
Claustrophobic in my head,
hopin' that you never see it
on my face
Put together on the outside;
on the inside, I'm 'bouta break
I need space, but I need love,
memories and amnesia
God got me through the seasons
when I didn't have a reason
Yeah, and now
I'm shootin'
at the stars and Mars
'Cause I just need some
Space
I just need some space (Ooh)
Space
I just need some space (Ooh)
Space
I just need some space (Ooh)
Space
I just need some space
Space
I just need some
